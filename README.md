# The relationship between US interest rates and public debt in developing countries

Following the Russo-Ukrainian war, the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States tightened its monetary policy. This raised the concern that higher US interest rates would increase the debt burden of developing countries through the exchange rate. Therefore, in this project, I explore the relationship between the US interest rates and the public debt in developing countries.

## Data:

1. **FRED**:
   - variable: US interest rates
   - Source: [FRED.org](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS)
2. **World Bank**:
   - variables: Region, income group, currency composition of debt, external debt stock (% of GNI), external debt stock (current US$), GNI per capita, GNI, exchange rate, population
   - Sources: [International debt statistics](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/international-debt-statistics#), [World development indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators), [Country classification income](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/new-world-bank-group-country-classifications-income-level-fy24)
